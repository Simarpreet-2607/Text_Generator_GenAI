# 📝 Text Completion Generator using Generative AI

This project implements a **Text Completion Generator** using **Generative AI**, specifically leveraging the **GPT-2** model from Hugging Face Transformers. The system takes a user-provided sentence or phrase and generates contextually relevant and grammatically accurate next sentences. It uses **Streamlit** to provide an interactive and user-friendly web interface for real-time sentence generation.

## 📌 Project Description

Text completion is a key task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves predicting the continuation of a given sentence or paragraph. With the rise of transformer-based models like GPT-2, machines can now generate human-like text with remarkable coherence and fluency.

This project showcases how pre-trained language models can be applied to real-world NLP tasks such as sentence prediction, writing assistance, and chatbot development.
